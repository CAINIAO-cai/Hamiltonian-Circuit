# Hamiltonian-Circuit
Backtracking algorithm to find a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph if one exists or to identify when there isn't one.

A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits every vertex once with no repeats. Being a circuit, it must start and end at the same vertex.

Test.py is the driver class which reads the adjacency matrices of circuits (directed or undirected) in the folder "tests". Test.py outputs whether the circuit is a hamiltonian circuit and also the number of vertices and edges in that circuit.
